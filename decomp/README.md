# Static decompilation workspace

This is part of the full-parity goal, not a separate experiment. It records the original routines used to reconstruct browser behavior. `generated/*.c` is Ghidra pseudocode, **not recovered, compilable Bullfrog source**. Names/types can come from community annotations or inference; generated control flow still needs review against instructions and runtime observations.

## Setup and reproduce

On this project's macOS arm64 development machine, with Python 3, Git and Xcode Command Line Tools:

```sh
python3 scripts/decomp.py setup
python3 scripts/decomp.py init /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe --metadata
python3 scripts/decomp.py export
python3 scripts/decomp.py check /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

Setup downloads SHA256-pinned Ghidra 12.1.3 and Temurin JDK 21, and builds Ghidra's native arm64 decompiler. `--cache /path/to/cache` reuses verified `ghidra.zip` and `jdk.tar.gz`. The repository includes the tool setup and analysis source; downloaded tool distributions, their licenses, external metadata checkout live in ignored `.tools/decomp/`. The Ghidra project lives in ignored `work/decomp/projects/`, because Ghidra rejects hidden directory components in project paths. The runtime does not bundle these tools. On other desktop systems, install the pinned Ghidra version and a compatible JDK and set `GHIDRA_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`; automatic installation is currently macOS arm64 only.

`init` imports the supplied executable without launching it. It creates a project named `populous`; use `--project-dir` and `--project-name` for a separate analysis. Existing imports are not overwritten. Run only one Ghidra operation against a project at a time. `export --program NAME.exe` must match the case of the imported filename. The default is `d3dpoptb.exe`.

`--metadata` fetches the pinned [pop3-rev](https://github.com/hrttf111/pop3-rev) XML and adds its annotations while retaining original memory and identity properties. **Its reference executable has a different SHA256.** It is a source of hypotheses, not matching official debug symbols. Omit the flag for an independent analysis. No upstream scripts are executed.

Every export hashes the actual loaded bytes of all eleven file-backed PE sections against `sections.tsv`, rather than trusting Ghidra's editable executable-hash property. Python also checks the entire executable before import. Unknown builds fail closed. Ghidra sometimes exits successfully after a Java script failure; the wrapper requires a fresh completion receipt and all requested files before replacing any exports.

To examine another routine:

```sh
python3 scripts/decomp.py export 0048a050 0048b950
# Export to a scratch directory for comparison, without changing tracked evidence:
python3 scripts/decomp.py export 00586074 --output .tools/decomp/comparison
```

To inspect callers or references to a data address, run `ExportCallers.java OUTPUT ADDRESS...` in Ghidra or through `analyzeHeadless -postScript`. It delegates to the same byte-checked exporter.

`exports.json` records the source executable, tool/metadata versions and hashes of the checked-in pseudocode. After a reviewed export update, regenerate its `files` hashes; `check` detects stale records. Analysis options and later type improvements can change pseudocode without changing behavior. The checked-in exports are review evidence, not a claim that every fresh Ghidra analysis produces identical C formatting or inferred types.

For each subsequent port, preserve the original branch ordering, integer widths/rounding, state transitions and scheduling when established. Record uncertainty rather than silently replacing it with a guessed rule. Add a runnable behavioral check and update the [detailed evidence log](../references/reverse-engineering.md) and [goal checklist](../GOAL.md). Existing browser tests establish internal consistency; they are not yet cross-engine replay evidence.

## Validation of this setup

Tested on macOS arm64: verified cached downloads, clean extraction and native decompiler build; fresh executable analysis and metadata import; 161 successful exports; actual section-byte checks; metadata and caller-export completion receipts; invalid-entry rejection without replacing existing evidence; hash verification and independent upstream math comparison. All eight gameplay regressions and TypeScript checking passed. Decompiler warnings and annotation conflicts remain review inputs, not proof of recovered source correctness. This tooling change does not change playable behavior.

## Native CPU comparison

The native math check emulates the supplied executable's `004e6ac0` movement
routine, the tile flag-writing prefix of `0044df40`, and `0044e940` height sampling
with Unicorn, then compares their outputs with the browser implementation. This
runs isolated x86 instructions and data tables; it does not start Windows or
emulate system calls. Inputs cover all quadrants, signed overflow, negative/odd
lengths, zero movement, and deterministic random cases. The executable hash is
verified before mapping its PE sections.

```sh
python3 -m venv .tools/decomp/oracle
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python -m pip install -r decomp/requirements.txt
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-math.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

The current check compares 508 movement cases and 680 terrain cases, including
wrapped cell boundaries, signed extremes, and rounded-mean ties. It proves equality
for those isolated inputs, not original scheduling, the whole shot processor,
terrain update processing beyond the diagonal flag, or all game physics. No original executable bytes are stored in its source or output.


## Campaign interpreter comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-script.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe /path/to/levels/cpscr010.dat
```

The oracle checks both executable and script hashes, maps the original interpreter,
and compares command order, external-read order, 64 variables, 48 byte attributes,
and the final instruction position. It covers 1,152 mission-script cases and 84
arithmetic/control-flow cases. Game commands are intercepted; external reads are
provided by the test host. This proves control-flow agreement for these inputs,
not the behavior of those game commands, recurring AI scheduling, or campaign parity.


The script oracle additionally runs 416 actual `DO GET_HEIGHT_AT_POS` commands
through native dispatch (`0048cc60` → `00492920`), with no interception of the
terrain query. It checks all 256 imported markers, odd coordinate bits and signed
height limits. Another 42 cases execute the original terrain-rule bytecode with
real native queries; only the final `004f2160` removal request is intercepted.
The browser comparison checks marker variables and head removal on the same turns.
The original header hash is verified before these comparisons.

## Campaign counter comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-campaign.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

Runs 1,280 spell-cast/stock queries and 1,024 head queries through the actual
original interpreter and command handlers, without intercepting game commands.
World-memory fixtures cover four cast-counter tribes, byte values, literal and
variable tribe arguments, aliased inputs/destinations, spell internal constants,
wrapped head coordinates and traversal past a non-head object. Another 220 calls
execute the original spell initializer with no shaman, no mana debit, no UI
notification and no opponent observers; its original allocation counter is
compared directly. These checks do not prove the full initializer, stock awards,
worship scheduling, the AI scheduler or unimplemented commands.


## Worship and reward comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-worship.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

Compares 4,344 native worship turns (including decay, refill, growth and signed
remaining counts) and 1,660 native automatic spell-reward turns (82-turn delivery,
four-shot cap and independent upper-nibble gift counter). Only the final deletion
leaf is intercepted. Worship uses actual native command eligibility; reward
fixtures skip visual initialization and Windows UI callbacks. These checks do not
prove browser eligibility, object scheduling, vault tasks, competitive ownership,
floating reward visuals or pickup behavior. Fifteen gameplay regressions cover
integration, including rewards surviving head removal and worship at full stock.


## Vault task comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-vault.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

Runs 640 native post-approach task transitions and 320 type-4 work/force/reset
cases. Task movement, animation, facing and sound leaves are intercepted; trigger
fixtures omit decorative/UI effects and final deletion. Real task branches,
timers, force-bit lookup and trigger work execute. The rendered stone pyramid is
verified separately against the editor's named geometry. Task model IDs address
native bank 2 (see below). Approach routing, occupancy, cleanup and full scheduler
behavior remain open.


## Object bank and morph comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-models.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
```

Compares all 256 bank-selector byte inputs and 7,595 native coordinate cases
against the actual importer and `app/morph.ts`. Only the selector's resource-load
leaf is intercepted; morph arithmetic executes without interception. Includes
both imported vault morphs at all frames, signed extremes and random inputs.
The original loader redirects bank 0 to 2. This does not verify the full native
object/morph scheduler, initial idle animation, routing or hut variant RNG.

To reproduce selected extraction without launching the installer:

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python -m pip install -r decomp/extraction-requirements.txt
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/extract-reference.py /path/to/PopulousTB-Setup.zip /path/to/game 'objects/*0-2.*'
python3 scripts/import-original.py /path/to/game
```

The importer also needs the previously extracted palette, atlas and animation
files listed in `public/original/provenance.json`. The extractor accepts a raw
Inno executable too; patterns are relative to its application directory. It
verifies payload checksums, rejects escaping paths and differing existing files,
and prints source SHA256 hashes. The optional extractor is separate from the
stdlib importer and native comparison dependencies.


## Campaign message comparison

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/extract-reference.py /path/to/PopulousTB-Setup.zip /path/to/game 'language/lang00.dat'
python3 scripts/import-messages.py /path/to/game
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-messages.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe /path/to/cpscr010.dat
```

The importer also uses the palette and HFX bank already listed in native asset
provenance. The check runs 160 original type-3 allocations, 320 original discovery
script cases and one removal. Only sound playback is intercepted. It compares
slot contents, serial wrap, text IDs, shared RNG and script variables. It does
not establish the rest of the original notification types, screen animation,
popup interaction or full campaign scheduling. The executable and mission script
are both hash-checked.


The campaign oracle also executes 40 native building-list rebuilds and 3,200
`PARTIAL_BUILDING_COUNT` query sequences through the actual interpreter. The
fixture disables mana processing, not the counter rebuild. All 256 imported
marker commands and 16 explicit hit/adjacent fixtures execute `TRIGGER_THING`
through real dispatch and cell lookup. No leaf is intercepted in these checks.
Browser progress/completion and active-object translation still approximate
native building states and rebuild scheduling.

The message oracle additionally compares 384 native settlement/vault tutorial
cases with supplied building counters. The worship oracle now checks 4,824 work
turns (480 with explicit force signals) and the unchanged 1,660 reward turns.
Force evaluation follows work sampling and is cleared by reset, rather than
cleared unconditionally each turn. See the detailed evidence log for fixture
scope, opcode names and unported phases.


## Opening flyby

`app/flyby.ts` reconstructs the event queue, script value encoding, position/angle/
zoom motion, presentation-frame scheduling and interruption from `00448ec0`–
`0044a1e0` and `00490590`–`00490ab0`. Mission-one words 936–1079 now execute
alongside the previously bound notification branches. Run:

```sh
.tools/decomp/oracle/bin/python scripts/check-native-flyby.py /path/to/d3dpoptb.exe
node qa/flyby-check.mjs
```

The CPU comparison fixes x87 precision at 53 bits (`0x027f`); startup/device-mode
precision is not established. It compares 1,000 profile calculations, 6,270 zoom
frames, 1,600 queue insertions and 4,077 complete opening frames, including native
VM decoding and interruption. UI/input/audio/debug leaves are intercepted;
keyframe handlers, arithmetic, event ordering and timeline control execute.
Interest-point tracking, native tooltips, early near-target input release,
projection and frame throttling remain incomplete. See the evidence log.
