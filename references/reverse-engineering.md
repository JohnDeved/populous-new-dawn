# Executable behaviour and effects pass

Analyzed the user-supplied `D3DPopTB.exe` statically with Ghidra 12.1.3, Temurin JDK 21 and a locally compiled arm64 Ghidra decompiler. SHA-256: `3a5065c7420b3fcde208bf220bc86dfbac95e025ab2492caf9c7ea5308dfbe4f`. The Windows executable was not executed or added to the browser build.

[hrttf111/pop3-rev](https://github.com/hrttf111/pop3-rev) provided Ghidra symbol/type metadata. Its reference executable hash differs from this installer, but PE section addresses/sizes match. The findings below were checked against the supplied binary, not assumed from names alone. Some community structure names remain provisional.

## Confirmed findings

| Address / input | Finding used in the browser |
| --- | --- |
| `0049c1a0`, `LEVELS/constant.dat` | Decodes the balance file with bytewise NOT/XOR and an eight-position rotating bit. First matching constant wins. The importer now produces `app/original-constants.json`. |
| `005a6d50` → `005a6858` | Person/action map → sprite-start/draw-type table. Shaman walk is 616 plus tribe×8; standing is 424 plus tribe×8. Braves carry with 72 and stand carrying with 80. Warrior combat uses the shared 128 sequence with weapon layers; 728 is a separate ground manoeuvre, not the normal attack. |
| `0045f9d0` | VELE layer selector is `(flags & 0x1f0) >> 4`, tribe/person variant is `flags >> 9`. Warrior draw type chooses layer 2, variant 2. Native shadows are separate from body layers. |
| `004673b0` | Camera-relative eight-way direction selection; VSTART nonzero mirror field flips the composite; shamans add tribe×8. Preserve signed element origins, including death frames whose artwork travels above the foot origin. |
| `004ee7b0`, draw records at `005a6ad7` | Person animation frame delays come from the draw record. The imported normal person sequences have a one-turn delay. Camera rotation changes the direction without resetting frame phase. |
| `00476570` | HFX effect pixels are **not ordinary palette indices**. For byte `v`, RGB comes from `PAL[AL[(v | 15) * 256]]`; alpha is `(v & 15) * 255 / 15`. Decode with level-one `AL0-C.DAT` and `PAL0-C.DAT`. |
| `00509c10`, `00513830`, `00511f70` | Native effect starts include explosion 1180, smoke 1224, sparkle 1288, small sparkle 1294, splash 1304 and lightning impact 1361. HFX frames now replace generic particle spheres. |
| `0050b630`, `0050b740`, `005aa510` | Blast has a distance-dependent launch with horizontal parameter 140, maximum distance parameter 0x500, and direct person damage 50. The browser previously inflicted 52 **display** health, killing a brave outright. Native health/damage are now scaled together by 20. |
| `004e6a70`, balance file | Native movement increments map X by sine and Z by cosine, on a 2048-angle circle. Native speeds: brave 70, warrior 59, shaman 58. |
| `004c1d10` | Spell processing has multiple stages, including a six-turn delay. Browser casting now has a six-turn wind-up and can be interrupted; the full original shot/state pipeline is not ported. |
| Balance file | Health 1000/1800/2000; melee damage 60/360/60; human warrior training base cost 3500 mana; hut population values 3/5/7; tree growth 2 per 16 turns; Land Bridge duration 64 turns. |

The existing level importer reflects original map Z. Native models now receive the same reflection, with negated native yaw in Three.js. A map-aligned east/up/south basis prevents unwanted orientation twist around the globe. Door approach points use that same conversion, rather than choosing whichever dry side happens to appear first. Native floor-contact tests still pass.

## Reproduce

```sh
python3 scripts/inspect-executable.py /path/to/D3DPopTB.exe
python3 scripts/import-original.py /path/to/extracted/game
npm test
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
# With npm run dev in another terminal:
node qa/browser-check.mjs
node qa/native-visuals.mjs
```

`inspect-executable.py` checks the exact executable hash and PE boundaries, then reads the small animation/damage tables. Its output is saved in `references/executable-tables.json`.

For decompilation, import the executable in Ghidra, optionally apply the pop3-rev XML metadata, and run the included `scripts/ghidra/ExportFunctions.java` with an output directory followed by hexadecimal function addresses. Headless example after creating a Ghidra project named `populous`:

```sh
analyzeHeadless /path/to/project populous -process D3DPopTB.exe -noanalysis \
  -scriptPath /path/to/populous-browser/scripts/ghidra \
  -postScript ExportFunctions.java /tmp/populous-analysis 00476570 0045f9d0 004ee7b0 0049c1a0
```

The local analysis project, decompiled C and original executable stay outside the application repository. The runtime remains TypeScript/Three.js.

## Remaining differences

This is a focused behaviour/rendering improvement, not an instruction-for-instruction engine port. The browser uses a 12-turn/second animation and movement conversion with a 30 Hz simulation. Exact original scheduling, all person substates, death selection, worship animation transitions, spell shot travel, cooldown/resource cancellation rules, AI decisions, formation/collision behaviour, population-band breeding/training modifiers and building damage are not all reproduced.

Birth/upgrade timers and mana income remain scaled browser rules. Terrain bridge interpolation uses the native duration but retains the browser's raised-strip shape and foundation protection. Lightning branches, shockwave geometry and effect placement/scales are browser implementations; native alpha frames/colours are decoded, but original palette quantization, all effect spawners and blend passes are not reproduced. Carrying uses the native body animation; the separate carried-log graphic remains to be traced. Sound remains synthesized.
